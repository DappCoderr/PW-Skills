// What is difference between Function Declaration and Expression?
/*
If you seen first key word as function then it's declaration otherwise it's expression.

function a(){} -> This is function declaration

const h = function process () {} -> This is function expression + This is named function expression 
const h = function () {} -> This is function expression + This is anonymous function expression
const h = () => {} -> This is function expression


Note: JavaScript is a Compiled and Interpreted language.

// Why in JS we consider function as first call function?
/*      -> You can store a function
        -> pass function as an argument
        -> Return a function from a function
        */
